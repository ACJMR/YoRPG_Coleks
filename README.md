This is our take on the classic RPG game genre! :octocat:


*Players may choose from three exciting protagonists*:
1. Wizard
    * Hailing from the Order of Ender nested in the Northern snowy peaks, Wizards have increased health and a **pointy hat**. :sparkles:
    * Wizards have an increased HP from 125 --> 200.
2. Tank
    * Pure muscle and steel, this character has greatly increased health and strength. His bulk, however, slows down his attack rate.
    * Tanks have an increased HP from 125 --> 500, but a decreased attack rate from 0.4 --> 0.2
3. Archer
    * A cunning and elegant character adventuring from the eastern Emerald Plains, what the archer lacks in health she makes up with increased attack rate.
    * Archers have an increased HP from 125 --> 175 and an increased attackRate from 0.4 --> 0.6


*Players may encounter three terrifying monsters on their journey*:

1. Slime
   * Bouncing from the Forests of Piloticus, slimes are fragile creatures, generally friendly unless you insult their fashion choices.
   * Slimes boast a lowered defense from 40 --> 10.
2. Kool Aid
   * Flowing from the Rivers of Nebraskaid, KoolAids are almost indestrucable. Practically no attack can faze their liquid bodies. 
   * KoolAids possess a heightened defense from 40 --> 150.
3. Orc
   * Terrifying ethereal beings hailing from the dank swamps of the Southern Delta, orcs are massive beasts, slow yet powerful.
   * Orcs have an increased HP from 150 --> 600, but a greatly reduced attack rate (1.0 --> 0.5).
4. Troll
   * Hailing from the caverns beneath the Western Plains, Trolls have superiour armour forged deep in their iron mines. 
   * Trolls have an increased defense from 20 --> 60.

**Come join us on our noble quest and slay the dragon!.**
